## Detect Skin Cancer Melanoma (malignant melanoma) 

Melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells that give colour to the skin become cancerous.
Symptoms might include a new, unusual growth or a change in an existing mole. Melanomas can occur anywhere on the body.
Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, medication or in some cases, chemotherapy.
